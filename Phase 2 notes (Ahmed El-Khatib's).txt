Checking operands in SIC/XE:

1- Start Label has a minimum length of 6 spaces added in object file to complete the minimum length (Write in object file) "Ahmed"

2- Address bigger than 2^20 byte is out of memory range in SIC/XE (1 MB) (While generating object code) "Amr"

3- We will add a new column in the symbol table (Absolute/relocatable) (Pass one)"Mina"

4- Each format from the 4 formats has a maximum operand size, which needs to be verified. (While generating object code)"Amr"

5- Operand handling: infix notation with spaces. Supported operators are
        +, -, *, /. The notation can have braces ( ).  (read file) "Amr"

6- For EQU and ORG instructions,
        any label in the operand must exist previously in the symbol table, else
        it would require three passes for the assembler.   (Pass one)"Ahmed"

7- LDA and similar LD instructions can take expressions.
        EXAMPLE: 	000003 al       word    10                                               
			000006 ko       word    2                                                
			000009          lda     al+5
			-------
			reloc   n=1 i=1 x=0   b=0 p=0 e=0
			000009 030008          lda   al+5
	also evaluating the infix expression (evaluation of infix) "this method 
		1-evaluates infix 
		2-returns also the type of result (relocatable or Absolute) 
		3-returrns true if evaluated correctly, or false if error happend " "Ahmed"

8- Finding object code: In the appendix, there are object codes for every instruction.
          we will have to edit it (generating object code) "Amr"

9- We need to edit the "BYTE" directive in case of hexadecimal operand; every
          2 hex characters are to be inserted in 1 byte, if characters are odd (11)
          then we will reserve 6 bytes.   (Pass one)"Mina"

10- the only directives that make object code(Byte , Word). their object code should be generated in pass 2 . "Mina"

11- We need a method that checks the object code size and possibility to embed it in
          the record. Parameters sent are LOC, format and starting address.
          There should be a special handling for RESW and RESB (new record
          in the object code file)   (To be called in pass two)"Ahmed"

12- Cases when operand is false:  (in evaluate infix 'sub of 7') "Ahmed"
          Operand doesn't exist in symbol table
          2 operators perceed each other (alpha + + beta)
	*note: the expression can contain (# or @) only once in the start of expression 
	*note: the expression can contain (,X) only once in the end of expression 

13- Required: checking operand for Indirect, immediate and indexed addressing.  (Generating object code)
****Note : indexing only sets the index flag "Amr"

14- Required: Making pass two structure."Mina"

15- Required: Method to write the intermediate file and a method to write the object file"Ahmed"
